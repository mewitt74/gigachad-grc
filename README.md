## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ (for local development)

### Running with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gigachad-grc.git
cd gigachad-grc
```

2. Copy environment file:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

3. Start all services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Run database migrations and seed data:
```bash
docker-compose exec controls npm run prisma:migrate
docker-compose exec frameworks npm run seed
```

5. Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Keycloak Admin: http://localhost:8080 (admin/admin)
- Traefik Dashboard: http://localhost:8090
- MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadminpassword)

### Local Development

1. Start infrastructure services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres redis keycloak minio
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Shared library
cd services/shared && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..

# Controls service
cd services/controls && npm install && cd ../..

# Frameworks service
cd services/frameworks && npm install && cd ../..

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

3. Run services:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Controls service
cd services/controls && npm run start:dev

# Terminal 2 - Frameworks service
cd services/frameworks && npm run start:dev

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## Production Readiness & Resilience

GigaChad GRC includes comprehensive built-in tools for ensuring production readiness:

### Production Validation CLI

Before deploying to production, run the validation script to check all configuration:

```bash
# Basic validation
npm run validate:production

# Strict mode (exit non-zero on warnings)
npm run validate:production:strict
```

The script validates:
- Security configuration (encryption keys, passwords, auth mode)
- Database connections and SSL
- Backup configuration
- Authentication setup (Keycloak)
- Network/CORS settings

### System Health Dashboard

Administrators can view real-time system health in **Settings > Organization Settings > System Health**:

- **System Health Banner**: Displays critical warnings for security issues, backup problems, and misconfigurations
- **Production Readiness Score**: 0-100 score indicating deployment readiness
- **Setup Wizard**: Guided configuration for new installations

### Automatic Features

When running with Docker, the entrypoint script provides:

| Feature | Environment Variable | Description |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| Auto-backup scheduling | `AUTO_BACKUP_ENABLED=true` | Schedules daily backups via cron |
| Database migrations | `AUTO_MIGRATE=true` | Runs migrations on startup |
| Dependency wait | `WAIT_FOR_DB=true` | Waits for PostgreSQL before starting |
| Config warnings | Always enabled | Logs warnings for production misconfigurations |

### Data Persistence

All critical data is stored in Docker named volumes that survive container restarts:

| Data Type | Volume | Survives Crash |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Database | `postgres_data` | ✅ Yes |
| Evidence Files | `minio_data` | ✅ Yes |
| Cache/Sessions | `redis_data` | ✅ Yes |
| Metrics | `prometheus_data` | ✅ Yes |

**Important**: Running `docker-compose down -v` will delete volumes. Always run backups before maintenance.

## Service Ports & Documentation

Each microservice runs on its own port with Swagger API documentation:

| Service | Port | Swagger Docs | Description |
|---------|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | 5173 | N/A | React SPA (Vite dev server) |
| **Controls** | 3001 | http://localhost:3001/api/docs | Controls, Evidence, Testing |
| **Frameworks** | 3002 | http://localhost:3002/api/docs | Frameworks, Risk Management |
| **Policies** | 3004 | http://localhost:3004/api/docs | Policy Lifecycle Management |
| **TPRM** | 3005 | http://localhost:3005/api/docs | Vendor Risk Management |
| **Trust** | 3006 | http://localhost:3006/api/docs | Questionnaires, KB, Trust Center |
| **Audit** | 3007 | http://localhost:3007/api/docs | Audit Management |
| **PostgreSQL** | 5433 | N/A | Primary database |
| **Redis** | 6380 | N/A | Cache & sessions |
| **Keycloak** | 8080 | http://localhost:8080 | Auth & SSO (admin/admin) |
| **Traefik** | 80/443 | http://localhost:8090 | API Gateway dashboard |
| **MinIO API** | 9000 | N/A | Object storage API |
| **MinIO Console** | 9001 | http://localhost:9001 | Storage admin UI |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Database user | grc |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password | grc_secret |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Database name | gigachad_grc |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | Redis password | redis_secret |
| `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN` | Keycloak admin user | admin |
| `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Keycloak admin password | admin |
| `MINIO_ROOT_USER` | MinIO root user | minioadmin |
| `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` | MinIO root password | minioadminpassword |
| `STORAGE_TYPE` | Storage backend (local/minio) | minio |

### Storage Configuration

The platform supports multiple storage backends:

**Local Storage:**
```env
STORAGE_TYPE=local
LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH=./storage
```

**MinIO/S3:**
```env
STORAGE_TYPE=minio
MINIO_ENDPOINT=minio
MINIO_PORT=9000
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minioadminpassword
MINIO_BUCKET=grc-evidence
```

## Module Extraction

Each service is designed to run independently. To extract a module:

1. Copy the service directory
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the service's environment
3. Run migrations: `npm run prisma:migrate`
4. Build and run: `docker build -t my-service . && docker run my-service`

## Security Considerations

- All passwords should be changed in production
- Enable TLS/SSL for all services
- Configure Keycloak for production use
- Use proper secrets management
- Review and harden Docker images
- Images should be pulled from Docker Hub's Hardened Images
