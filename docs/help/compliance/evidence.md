## Best Practices

### Evidence Quality
- ✅ Include timestamps in screenshots
- ✅ Use descriptive file names
- ✅ Add context in the description
- ✅ Collect from authoritative sources
- ❌ Don't upload personally sensitive data
- ❌ Avoid blurry or cropped screenshots

### Organization
- Create a consistent naming convention
- Use categories and tags consistently
- Link evidence to all relevant controls
- Set realistic expiration dates

### Security
- Evidence may contain sensitive information
- Access is controlled by permissions
- Consider redacting confidential data
- Audit logs track all access

## Automation

### Automated Collection
Integrate with systems to auto-collect evidence:
- Use **Integrations** to connect systems
- Schedule periodic evidence pulls
- Auto-link to relevant controls

### Evidence Collectors
Configure evidence collectors for:
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Identity providers
- SIEM systems
- Endpoint management

See [Integrations](../integrations/connecting-integrations.md) for setup.
