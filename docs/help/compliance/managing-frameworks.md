## Adding a Framework

### Step 1: Choose Your Framework

1. Navigate to **Frameworks**
2. Click **Add Framework**
3. Browse or search for your framework
4. Click **Select**

### Step 2: Review Default Settings

Each framework comes with:
- **Requirements**: Individual compliance requirements
- **Control Mappings**: Suggested controls for each requirement
- **Scoring Model**: How readiness is calculated

Review and adjust as needed for your organization.

### Step 3: Activate Framework

1. Click **Activate Framework**
2. Framework appears in your active frameworks list
3. Controls are automatically mapped

## Framework Dashboard

Each framework has a dedicated dashboard showing:

### Readiness Score
A percentage indicating overall compliance readiness:
- **90-100%**: Audit-ready
- **70-89%**: Good progress, minor gaps
- **50-69%**: Significant work needed
- **Below 50%**: Major gaps to address

### Requirement Status
Visual breakdown of requirements:
- ✅ **Met**: All mapped controls implemented
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Controls partially implemented
- ❌ **Not Met**: No controls implemented
- ⚪ **Not Applicable**: Explicitly marked N/A

### Gap Analysis
Identifies:
- Missing controls
- Evidence gaps
- Documentation needs

## Mapping Controls to Frameworks

Controls can be mapped to multiple frameworks simultaneously.

### Automatic Mapping
When you activate a framework:
1. System suggests control mappings based on standard mappings
2. Existing controls are matched by ID and category
3. Review and approve suggested mappings

### Manual Mapping
1. Open a control
2. Go to **Framework Mappings** tab
3. Click **Add Mapping**
4. Select the framework and requirement
5. Save

### Bulk Mapping
1. Go to **Frameworks** → [Your Framework]
2. Click **Bulk Mapping**
3. Upload a CSV with control-to-requirement mappings
4. Review and confirm

## Multi-Framework Compliance

Many controls satisfy multiple frameworks:

```
Control: MFA-001 - Require MFA for all users

Satisfies:
├── SOC 2 CC6.1 - Logical access security
├── ISO 27001 A.9.4.2 - Secure log-on procedures  
├── NIST CSF PR.AC-7 - Authentication
└── HIPAA §164.312(d) - Person authentication
```

### Benefits
- Implement once, satisfy many
- Reduce audit preparation time
- Unified view of compliance status

### Viewing Cross-Framework Impact
1. Open any control
2. Check **Framework Mappings** section
3. See all requirements this control satisfies

## Preparing for Audits

### Audit Readiness Checklist
For each framework:

- [ ] All requirements have mapped controls
- [ ] All controls have evidence
- [ ] Evidence is current (within validity period)
- [ ] Policies are published and acknowledged
- [ ] Risk assessments are documented

### Generating Audit Reports
1. Go to **Frameworks** → [Your Framework]
2. Click **Generate Report**
3. Select report type:
   - **Executive Summary**: High-level overview
   - **Detailed Report**: Full evidence package
   - **Gap Report**: Outstanding items only
4. Download or share with auditors

## Framework Best Practices

### Start Simple
1. Begin with your primary framework (usually SOC 2 or ISO 27001)
2. Achieve strong compliance baseline
3. Add additional frameworks as needed

### Maintain Continuously
- Don't treat compliance as a one-time project
- Schedule regular reviews (monthly recommended)
- Keep evidence fresh and controls updated

### Leverage Automation
- Connect integrations for automated evidence collection
- Use scheduled evidence refresh
- Set up alerts for expiring evidence
