# Risk Management Guide

Effective risk management is at the heart of any compliance program. GigaChad GRC provides comprehensive tools to identify, assess, treat, and monitor security risks.

## Understanding Risk Management

### What is a Risk?

A risk is the potential for an event to negatively impact your organization's objectives. In security context:

```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact
```

### Risk Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Strategic** | Risks to business objectives | Market changes, competition |
| **Operational** | Risks to daily operations | System failures, process errors |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory and legal risks | Audit failures, data breaches |
| **Financial** | Monetary impact risks | Fraud, economic changes |
| **Reputational** | Brand and trust risks | PR incidents, customer loss |
| **Security** | Information security risks | Cyber attacks, data theft |

## Creating a Risk

### Step 1: Identify the Risk

1. Navigate to **Risks**
2. Click **Create Risk**
3. Provide basic information:
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive name
   - **Description**: What could happen and why
   - **Category**: Primary risk category
   - **Owner**: Person responsible for managing this risk

### Step 2: Assess Likelihood

How likely is this risk to occur?

| Level | Description | Probability |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Rare** | May occur only in exceptional circumstances | < 5% |
| **Unlikely** | Could occur at some time | 5-25% |
| **Possible** | Might occur at some time | 25-50% |
| **Likely** | Will probably occur | 50-75% |
| **Almost Certain** | Expected to occur | > 75% |

### Step 3: Assess Impact

If the risk occurs, how severe would it be?

| Level | Description | Financial Impact |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Negligible** | Minor inconvenience | < $10K |
| **Minor** | Some impact, easily recovered | $10K - $100K |
| **Moderate** | Significant impact, recoverable | $100K - $1M |
| **Major** | Serious impact, difficult to recover | $1M - $10M |
| **Severe** | Catastrophic, potentially existential | > $10M |

### Step 4: Calculate Risk Level

The system automatically calculates risk level:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    RISK MATRIX                              │
├────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────────┤
│ Likelihood │ Negligible│ Minor    │ Moderate │ Major/Severe │
├────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────┤
│ Almost     │ Medium   │ High     │ Critical │ Critical     │
│ Certain    │          │          │          │              │
├────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────┤
│ Likely     │ Low      │ Medium   │ High     │ Critical     │
├────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────┤
│ Possible   │ Low      │ Medium   │ Medium   │ High         │
├────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────┤
│ Unlikely   │ Very Low │ Low      │ Medium   │ Medium       │
├────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────┤
│ Rare       │ Very Low │ Very Low │ Low      │ Medium       │
└────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────────┘
```

## Risk Treatment

After identifying a risk, decide how to handle it:

### Treatment Options

#### 1. Mitigate
Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact.
- **When**: Risk level is unacceptable and controls are cost-effective
- **Example**: Implement MFA to reduce unauthorized access risk

#### 2. Transfer
Shift risk to another party.
- **When**: Risk cannot be fully mitigated internally
- **Example**: Cyber insurance, outsourcing to specialists

#### 3. Accept
Acknowledge and monitor the risk.
- **When**: Risk level is acceptable or mitigation cost exceeds benefit
- **Example**: Accept minor operational risks

#### 4. Avoid
Eliminate the activity causing the risk.
- **When**: Risk level is too high and no acceptable treatment exists
- **Example**: Stop using a vulnerable system

### Creating a Treatment Plan

1. Open the risk record
2. Click **Add Treatment**
3. Select treatment type
4. Document:
   - Specific actions to take
   - Responsible party
   - Target completion date
   - Expected residual risk

## Risk Scenarios

Risk scenarios help model complex threats:

### What is a Risk Scenario?

A detailed narrative describing:
- Threat actor (who)
- Attack vector (how)
- Target assets (what)
- Business impact (why it matters)

### Creating a Scenario

1. Go to **Risks** → **Risk Scenarios**
2. Click **Create Scenario**
3. Fill in details:
   - **Title**: Descriptive name
   - **Category**: Type of scenario
   - **Threat Actor**: Who poses the threat
   - **Attack Vector**: How they would attack
   - **Target Assets**: What they'd target
   - **Likelihood & Impact**: Assessed levels

### Scenario Templates

Use pre-built templates for common scenarios:
- Ransomware attack
- Data breach via phishing
- Insider threat
- DDoS attack
- Supply chain compromise

### Scenario Simulation

Model "what-if" analysis:
1. Open a scenario
2. Click **Simulate**
3. Adjust variables:
   - Control effectiveness
   - Response time
   - Additional mitigations
4. View projected outcomes

## Risk Dashboard

The risk dashboard provides:

### Heat Map
Visual representation of all risks by likelihood/impact.

### Trend Analysis
Track how risk levels change over time.

### Top Risks
Highest priority risks requiring attention.

### Treatment Progress
Status of all mitigation activities.

## Risk Reviews

### Scheduling Reviews

Set up regular risk reviews:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Risk Configuration**
2. Set review frequency by risk level:
   - Critical: Monthly
   - High: Quarterly
   - Medium: Semi-annually
   - Low: Annually

### Conducting Reviews

During each review:
1. Verify risk still exists
2. Re-assess likelihood and impact
3. Update treatment progress
4. Document any changes
5. Approve continued treatment approach

### Review Documentation

All reviews are logged with:
- Reviewer name
- Review date
- Changes made
- Next review date

## Reporting

### Risk Register Export
Export full risk register to:
- Excel (detailed)
- PDF (formatted report)
- CSV (data analysis)

### Executive Summary
High-level overview for leadership:
- Risk count by level
- Top risks
- Treatment progress
- Year-over-year trends

### Board Reports
Formatted reports suitable for board presentations:
- Risk appetite metrics
- Key risk indicators
- Notable changes

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Comprehensive
Document all significant risks, not just technical ones.

### 2. Assign Ownership
Every risk needs a clear owner accountable for treatment.

### 3. Regular Reviews
Risks change—review and update regularly.

### 4. Link to Controls
Connect risks to the controls that mitigate them.

### 5. Document Decisions
Record why risks are accepted or treatments chosen.

### 6. Communicate
Share risk information with relevant stakeholders.
