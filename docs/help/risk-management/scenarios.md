# Risk Scenarios

Risk scenarios model potential threat events to understand their likelihood, impact, and business implications. This advanced feature helps with strategic risk planning.

## Overview

Scenario analysis allows you to:
- Model hypothetical risk events
- Understand potential consequences
- Test response readiness
- Plan mitigation strategies
- Support business continuity planning

## Scenario Types

### Threat Scenarios
Model specific threat actors and vectors:
- Ransomware attack
- Data breach by insider
- Supply chain compromise
- Natural disaster

### Business Impact Scenarios
Model business consequences:
- Key vendor failure
- Regulatory violation
- Reputation incident
- Market disruption

### Combined Scenarios
Link threat and business impact:
- Cyberattack → Data breach → Regulatory fine → Reputation damage

## Creating a Scenario

### Basic Information
1. Navigate to **Risk Management → Scenarios**
2. Click **Create Scenario**
3. Enter:
   - **Title**: Descriptive name
   - **Description**: Detailed scenario narrative
   - **Category**: Scenario type

### Threat Details
Define the threat:
- **Threat Actor**: Who/what causes this (insider, external, natural)
- **Attack Vector**: How it happens
- **Motivation**: Why it might happen
- **Capability**: Attacker's resources

### Impact Analysis
Estimate consequences:
- **Financial Impact**: Dollar range
- **Operational Impact**: Disruption level
- **Reputational Impact**: Brand damage
- **Regulatory Impact**: Compliance violations

### Likelihood Assessment
Estimate probability:
- Base likelihood (without controls)
- Factors increasing likelihood
- Factors decreasing likelihood

### Affected Assets
Link to assets at risk:
1. Click **Add Assets**
2. Select from asset inventory
3. Document how each is affected

### Related Risks
Connect to existing risks:
1. Click **Link Risks**
2. Select related risks from register
3. Scenario informs risk assessment

## Scenario Analysis

### Single Scenario
Analyze one scenario in depth:
- Walk through sequence of events
- Identify decision points
- Document potential outcomes
- Estimate probability of each outcome

### Scenario Comparison
Compare multiple scenarios:
- Side-by-side impact comparison
- Combined probability assessment
- Resource allocation priority

### Monte Carlo Simulation
For quantitative analysis:
1. Define ranges for variables
2. Run simulation (1000+ iterations)
3. Get probability distribution
4. Identify most likely outcomes

## Response Planning

### Preventive Controls
Document controls that prevent the scenario:
- Existing controls
- Planned controls
- Control gaps

### Detective Controls
Controls that detect the scenario occurring:
- Monitoring capabilities
- Alert thresholds
- Detection time estimates

### Response Actions
Planned response if scenario occurs:
- Immediate actions
- Communication plan
- Recovery steps

### Recovery Time
Estimate recovery:
- Time to detect
- Time to contain
- Time to recover
- Time to full normal operations

## Scenario Templates

### Pre-Built Templates
Use industry-standard scenarios:
- Ransomware attack
- Data breach
- Denial of service
- Third-party breach
- Physical security incident
- Regulatory investigation

### Custom Templates
Create your own:
1. Build a scenario
2. Click **Save as Template**
3. Use for similar future scenarios

## Exercises

### Tabletop Exercise
Use scenarios for exercises:
1. Select a scenario
2. Gather stakeholders
3. Walk through the scenario
4. Discuss responses
5. Document findings

### Exercise Mode
1. Open scenario
2. Click **Start Exercise**
3. Step through phases
4. Record decisions and discussion
5. Generate exercise report

## Reporting

### Scenario Report
Generate detailed report:
- Scenario description
- Impact analysis
- Likelihood assessment
- Response readiness
- Recommendations

### Executive Summary
High-level overview:
- Top scenarios by impact
- Readiness assessment
- Investment recommendations

### Trend Analysis
Track scenarios over time:
- New emerging scenarios
- Changing likelihood
- Improving/degrading readiness

## Best Practices

### Scenario Selection
- Focus on realistic scenarios
- Include both likely and severe
- Update for emerging threats

### Regular Updates
- Review scenarios quarterly
- Update for new information
- Retire outdated scenarios

### Stakeholder Involvement
- Include business leaders
- Get technical input
- Executive sponsorship

### Action Follow-Through
- Track improvement actions
