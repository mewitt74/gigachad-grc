# Employee Compliance Tracking

GigaChad GRC's Employee Compliance module helps you track and manage employee security training, background checks, and equipment compliance across your organization.

## Overview

Employee compliance is essential for:
- **Security Awareness**: Ensuring employees understand security policies

|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Employee Roster** | BambooHR, Workday, Gusto, ADP | Names, departments, hire dates |
| **Training Records** | KnowBe4, Proofpoint, Curricula | Course completion, scores, dates |
| **Background Checks** | Checkr, Certn, Sterling | Check status, completion dates |
| **Device Compliance** | Jamf, Intune, Kandji | Assigned devices, compliance status |
| **Access Management** | Okta, Azure AD | Systems access, MFA enrollment |
