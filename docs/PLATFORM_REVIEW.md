---

## Executive Summary

The GigaChad GRC platform is **~98% complete** for the planned feature set. Phase 1 critical fixes have been addressed. The frontend and backend build successfully with all major features implemented. The platform is ready for testing and deployment.

---

## ✅ Phase 4 Completed (December 8, 2025)

### AI & MCP Integration
- **AI Configuration UI**: Settings page at `/settings/ai` with provider selection (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- **AI Model Updates**: Updated to latest models:
  - OpenAI: GPT-5, GPT-5 Mini, o3, o3-mini
  - Anthropic: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku
- **MCP Server Management**: Settings page at `/settings/mcp` for server deployment and monitoring
- **MCP Servers Created**:
  - `grc-evidence`: Evidence collection from AWS, Azure, GitHub, Okta, Jamf, etc.
  - `grc-compliance`: Automated SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR checks
  - `grc-ai-assistant`: AI-powered risk analysis, control suggestions, policy drafting
- **Workflow Engine**: MCP workflow creation and execution with scheduling triggers
- **Documentation**: Complete help articles for AI and MCP configuration

### Navigation Updates

- Added MCP Servers to Settings sidebar
- Updated all API route documentation

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Completed (December 7, 2025)

### Training Backend Implementation
- **Prisma Schema**: Added `TrainingProgress`, `TrainingAssignment`, and `TrainingCampaign` models
- **Backend Module**: Created full training module at `services/controls/src/training/` with:
  - CRUD endpoints for progress tracking
  - Assignment management (individual and bulk)
  - Campaign management for admin users
  - Organization-wide statistics
- **Frontend Integration**: Updated `lib/training.ts` to use API with localStorage fallback
- **Vite Proxy**: Added `/api/training` proxy configuration

### Code Cleanup
- **Console.log statements**: All cleaned up (0 remaining)
- **Console.error statements**: Using proper error handling

### Previously Completed (Verified Working)
- **Audit Findings**: Full CRUD implementation at `services/audit/src/findings/`
- **Email Integration**: `ConfigurableEmailService` supports SMTP, SendGrid, SES
- **Evidence Download**: Implementation at `Evidence.tsx:278-296` working

---

## 🟡 Remaining Issues (Lower Priority)

### 1. Backend Dependency Versions
**Location**: `services/shared/package.json`

NestJS versions could be standardized across all services for consistency. Currently working with `--legacy-peer-deps`.

### 2. Large Bundle Size
**Frontend Build Output**:
```
dist/assets/index-Cm2WXfFG.js   2,222.53 kB │ gzip: 584.03 kB
```

The main bundle exceeds 500KB. Code splitting has been implemented for vendor chunks but could be further optimized with lazy route loading.

### 3. Contract Detail System User
**Location**: `frontend/src/pages/ContractDetail.tsx:492`

Hardcoded system user instead of auth context:
```tsx
'x-user-id': 'system', // TODO: Get from auth context
```
